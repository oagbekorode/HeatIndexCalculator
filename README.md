# Heat Index Calculator
This project calculates the Heat Index (the "feels like" temperature) using user-provided temperature and humidity values. It applies the official National Weather Service heat index formula, which combines multiple coefficients (c1–c9) to produce accurate results.
## Features

- Accepts temperature (°F) and humidity (%) as inputs

- Implements the official National Weather Service heat index formula

- Stores values with encapsulation and constants (final)

- Uses Math.pow() for exponent calculations

- Prints clear, user-friendly results
